# Part-of-Speech Tagging using Keras
## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging model using recurrent neural networks (Bidirectional LSTMs) and pre-trained word embeddings. The notebook uses the Brown Corpus for text data and GloVe embeddings fo word representations.
The notebook in this repository  was created on Kaggle, using their Tesla P100 GPU as the accelerator for training the model.  
You can view the notebook and run it directly on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/beasttitan/pos-tagging).
